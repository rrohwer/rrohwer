### Robin R. Rohwer
I research microbial ecology and evolution in a 20-year freshwater lake time series.  
Check out my github repos to help you with your own freshwater microbial ecology research:  
* [TaxAss](www.github.com/mcmahonlab/taxass): Improve your 16S analysis with freshwater-specific taxonomy assignments.  
* [limony](www.github.com/rrohwer/limony): Explore a 20-year, 500-sample freshwater time series yourself with my date release package.
